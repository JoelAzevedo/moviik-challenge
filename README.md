![Preview of the interface](https://i.imgur.com/x0p4r6c.png)

This interface contains a list of multiple cards, each one with a quote, a rating and an author. All the information is fetched from here: https://programming-quotes-api.herokuapp.com/.

The card list forms a responsive masonry layout and the quotes can be navigated by page. A cache mechanism was built to minimize the number of API calls.

The project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.7.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

<!-- ## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/). -->
